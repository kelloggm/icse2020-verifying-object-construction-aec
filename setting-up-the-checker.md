Setting up our checker
----------------------

To clone projects into /tmp/ and install two jar files into your local Maven repository:

1. Install the prerequisites listed at https://checkerframework.org/manual/#build-source .
2. Run `dependencies.sh` from this directory.  This will take several minutes.

[TODO: Is there anything to say about setting the `CHECKERFRAMEWORK` environment variable?]

[TODO: Must you use Java 8?  For example, on Ubuntu run:
update-java-alternatives --set java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
]
